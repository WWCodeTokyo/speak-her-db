# SpeakHer

https://speakher.jp/

SpeakHer is a database of women public speakers in Japan. A common excuse we hear from conference and event organizers is how they can't find any women. Let's banish that excuse. Please join our list and make sure that women get fair representation for public speaking engagements.

The purpose of gathering this information is so that event organizers can easily search for female speakers and that fellow speakers can connect with and support each other

### Database connection

This project uses Airtable as a data source. Follow these steps to configure a database on your local environment:

1. Make a copy of `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env.development`
2. Register as a contributor of the Airtable development database [cliking here](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invLCTAgGOsrWkXGM&inviteToken=3280cfd046a759fbcf5cb70371fbfab6dd306c9ce9851c2bd50da6de57b04121)
3. Get your Airtable API Key on your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account)
4. Get the development database ID on the [Dev DB Docs](https://airtable.com/appHpbskGp4dMpqEO/api/docs#javascript/introduction)
5. Edit `.env.development` to add your `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and the development `AIRTABLE_DB_ID`

`.env.development`
```
NODE_ENV=development
VUE_APP_AIRTABLE_DB_ID=[dev database ID here]
VUE_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=[your api key here]
AIRTABLE_DB_ID=[dev database ID here]
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=[your api key here]
```

You can change other DB configs on `/plugins/airtable.js`.

Further information on the database schema and query documentation [here](https://airtable.com/appHpbskGp4dMpqEO/api/docs#javascript/introduction) (login with the account you registered on step 2).
